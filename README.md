This project will schedule sections of courses for CIS department. The scheduling
entails assigning room and time to a section of a course.
An example would be CSC350-1200 Mondays from 1:00PM to 3:45PM in room F905
and Wednesdays from 12:00PM to 1:40PM in room F905

The input will be a course number and the number of days that the course is to be
scheduled and a list of available rooms. The input will be a data file with this data.
The output will be
a) a listing of all scheduled sections with course number, section number,
start time, end time and room number;
b) a selection of room numbers with a weekly grid of each course section
that is scheduled for that room.

The project will be accomplished in phases:

I.  Planning: Determine the resources, timing and any constraints. Create a
GANTT chart for the schedule. Assign tasks to resources.
Deliverable: GANTT chart, a description of the project

II.  Systems Analysis and Requirements: Determine the needs of the users,
interview stakeholders. Create a list of requirements for accomplishing the
project and a Data Flow Diagram of the processes. There will be two
opportunities to interview the stakeholders.
Deliverable: Data Flow Diagram (Context, Level 0 and Level 1)

III.  System Design: Detailed design of the system. Create prototype of
input/output interfaces, Entity-Relationship Diagram and Use case diagram
Deliverable: Entity-Relationship Diagram and Use case diagram

IV. Development: Creation of programs and any other elements needed for
the project. The project will require XAMP stack as its development environment.
Deliverable: User interface(s), Database dictionary.

V. Testing: Creation of sample dataset, to test the system.

Deliverable: Sample test data

VI. Implementation: Complete testing and post the system on the common
web site.
